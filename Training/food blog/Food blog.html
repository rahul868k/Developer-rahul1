            Fish biryani is a layered rice dish made with fish, basmati rice, spices & herbs.

                  <p>
                     In American English, kebab with no qualification refers to shish kebab cooked on a skewer,
                      whereas in Europe it refers to doner kebab. ... According to Sevan Nişanyan, an etymologist of the Turkish language,
                       the word kebab is derived from the Persian word “kabab” meaning “fry”.

                  <p> 
                     It's better to get stuck into your lunch sooner rather than later between 12.30pm and 1pm,
                      with 12.38pm the best time. And when it comes to dinner, the later you leave it the worse it can be for your diet 
                      – the optimum time for dinner is between 6pm and 6.30pm, 6.14pm preferably.

         <p>Good news for mice-and perhaps just another reason for us to say goodbye to late-night meals and snacks.
             Avoid large meals late at night. According to the National Institutes of Health, 
             late-night meals can cause indigestion that interferes with sleep. 
             The same goes for alcohol.17-Jan-2021.</p>
